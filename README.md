# Decor ‚Äì Dynamic Interior-Design Store (2020)

A **fully responsive** one-page website + mini e-shop built in early 2020 as a school project.  
The goal was to practice vanilla **JavaScript** (AJAX, JSON, localStorage), Bootstrap 4 layout, and a touch of jQuery/AOS for animations‚Äîwithout relying on any pre-made template.
